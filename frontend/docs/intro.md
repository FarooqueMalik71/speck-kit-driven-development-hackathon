# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the **AI-Native Textbook for Embodied Intelligence**. This comprehensive resource combines traditional textbook content with AI-powered interactive features to provide an advanced learning experience in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, focusing on the integration of perception, reasoning, and action in physical environments. Unlike traditional AI that operates primarily in digital spaces, Physical AI systems must understand and interact with the physical world through sensors and actuators.

## What are Humanoid Robots?

Humanoid robots are designed to resemble and interact with humans in human-centered environments. These systems require sophisticated control algorithms, perception systems, and cognitive capabilities to operate effectively. They represent one of the most challenging and fascinating frontiers in robotics.
