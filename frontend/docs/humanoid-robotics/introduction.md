# Introduction to Humanoid Robotics

## What are Humanoid Robots?

Humanoid robots are designed to resemble and interact with humans in human-centered environments. These systems require sophisticated control algorithms, perception systems, and cognitive capabilities to operate effectively. The human-like form factor provides several advantages:

- **Intuitive Interaction**: Humans find it natural to interact with human-like robots
- **Environmental Compatibility**: Designed to operate in spaces built for humans
- **Social Acceptance**: More readily accepted in social contexts than other robot forms
- **Generalization**: Capable of performing a wide range of human-like tasks

## Historical Development

The field of humanoid robotics has evolved over several decades, with significant milestones including:

- **Early Mechanical Automata**: 18th and 19th century mechanical figures
- **Modern Research Platforms**: Honda's ASIMO, Sony's QRIO, and other research robots
- **Commercial Systems**: NAO, Pepper, and other commercially available robots
- **Advanced Platforms**: Atlas, HRP series, and state-of-the-art research platforms
