**Storage**: Qdrant Cloud (vector), Neon Serverless Postgres (relational), GitHub (content)
**Testing**: pytest for backend, Jest for frontend, contract tests for API
**Target Platform**: Web application (Vercel deployment)
**Project Type**: Web application with frontend and backend components
**Performance Goals**: 95% API requests respond within 2 seconds, AI responses within 5 seconds
**Constraints**: Qdrant Cloud free tier limits (1GB, 1M vectors), Vercel usage limits, OpenAI quotas
**Scale/Scope**: Support 1,000+ concurrent users during peak educational hours

**Structure Decision**: Web application with separate backend and frontend components to enable proper separation of AI processing services from content delivery, with documentation integrated via Docusaurus.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |

## Execution Strategy

### 1. Execution Strategy

The implementation will follow a phase-based approach with clear milestones and parallel workstreams. The single developer will be assisted by AI agents for rapid development, code review, and testing. The focus will be on building a minimum viable product (MVP) that demonstrates core functionality while maintaining code quality and system reliability.

Key principles:
- Build incrementally with continuous validation
- Prioritize core features over nice-to-have functionality
- Use proven technologies and patterns to minimize risk
- Maintain clean, testable code architecture
- Implement monitoring and observability from the start
